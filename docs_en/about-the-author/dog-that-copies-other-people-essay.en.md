Plagiarism dogs are really annoying. . .

I heard from a friend that my article was stolen again on Zhihu, and was used intact by others to divert traffic.

And! ! ! This is not the most annoying thing.

The original source that this person also noted at the end of the article is not mine. . .

In other words, there is another plagiarism dog in CSDN who stole this article of mine and claimed the originality. Zhihu plagiarism dog has moved the article of this CSDN plagiarism dog intact.

It’s so outrageous that his mother opened the door for outrageous things. It’s so outrageous.

I opened the original source link marked by Zhihu Plagiarism Dog. Oh my god, it’s exactly the same content, and it also shows the originality.

I took a look at the CSDN plagiarism dog's article. He has moved my highly praised answer all over the place. . . Really diligent. . .

I don’t want to say more about CSDN. It’s just a large article dump, filled with all kinds of non-standard reprints and all kinds of garbage resources for paid downloads. This technology website, which is said to have the largest traffic in the country, is disgusting. It’s so popular that it’s ugly. If you can’t use it, don’t use it!

For example, when I usually search on Google, I directly block the CSDN site. Just download a Chrome extension called Personal Blocklist and add blog.csdn.net to the blacklist.

My articles have basically been stolen. The key is that I don’t get much traffic when I post them myself. On the contrary, the people who steal my articles have more traffic than me, the original author.

What kind of world is this? Is it the distortion of human nature or the loss of morality?

However, it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if CSDN, a junk website, doesn’t post articles.

Take a look at what kind of garbage the articles on the CSDN hot list are. They are either various advertisements or some patchwork articles with no quality.

Of course, there are also a very small number of high-quality articles, such as articles by bloggers such as Tao Ge, Er Ge, Binghe, and Micro Technology.

There are also many video platforms (such as Douyin and Bilibili) where many bloggers directly use other people’s original works to make videos to attract traffic or fans.

The stolen article mentioned today was once used by a training institution to make a video to attract traffic.
