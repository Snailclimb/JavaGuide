When it comes to the college entrance exam, it seems like countless people have a lot to say. Today, I'll take this opportunity to briefly talk about my high school experience.

To be honest, my high school journey was anything but ordinary, even a bit surreal, so I have a lot I want to share.

This article will cover my journey from middle school to high school. I won't go into too much detail in each part, just a simple chat.

**Everything that follows is true, with no exaggeration, though it might seem a little surreal.**

## First Contact with Computers

I first encountered computers when I was in the fifth grade. We didn't have a computer at home, so my first internet experiences were in illegal internet cafes.

An illegal internet cafe looked something like this: a windowless room packed with old computers, very crowded.

My time in these cafes was full of ups and downs. I often ran into police inspections or got harassed by older kids. In over a year of going to these cafes, I was there for two police inspections, which were mainly to check for minors (the cafes were almost entirely filled with them). It felt more like they were trying to get a little something from the owner. Harassment from older kids was more frequent. They would often take my computer and threaten me for all my money. I was quite timid back then, and after being beaten a few times, I tried to go at times when the older kids weren't around and only carried a little money with me. I was a rather independent child and usually didn't tell my family about things that happened outside (because it wouldn't have helped much; my family didn't provide a strong sense of security).

I can't quite remember if it was my brother or my sister who first took me to an internet cafe. I think it was my sister.

At first, I just played single-player games like *Meteor Blade* and motorcycle games. I wasn't addicted, but I found them really fun. I could play for a whole afternoon and would be reluctant to leave.

## Becoming Addicted After Elementary School

My addiction started after I graduated from elementary school, after I started playing a game called **QQ Speed** (I think I started at the end of sixth grade). Damn, I was completely hooked. **Every day in class, I would fantasize about drifting in a car. That's right, I thought I was the God of Racing of Mount Akina!**

My skills were pretty good at the time. It seemed like no one in the entire internet cafe could beat me (we often had open challenges).

QQ Speed was quite popular back then, and many people born in the 90s should be familiar with it.

I remember you didn't need an ID to get online back then. You could just get a 10-yuan internet card, and the fee was one yuan per hour. I often skipped breakfast to save money for gaming. Whenever I had money in my pocket, my friends and I would race to the internet cafe to play QQ Speed together. Good times!

> Speaking of which, I can't help but open my Windows computer, download Wegame, and then download QQ Speed.

By the second year of middle school, I had stopped playing QQ Speed. My level was permanently stuck at **120**, which was a very high level back in those days when leveling up was incredibly difficult.

## The Addiction Exploded in Eighth Grade

My gaming addiction really took off after I started middle school. It was at its worst in the eighth grade. I was completely obsessed with a game called **CrossFire**, even more so than QQ Speed. Every day in class, I would imagine myself holding a gun and sweeping through the enemy's camp. My mind was not on my studies at all.

I would often wake up early to use the computers left by people who had played all night, since I didn't have much money as a student. I would sneak out almost every Friday night after my family was asleep to play all night. I pulled countless all-nighters in eighth grade, and that's how I became nearsighted.

Being a gaming addict is terrifying. You'd do anything to get online. My family lived in the insulation layer on the top floor. Every time I snuck out at night to play, I had to climb out of my room's window, cross several buildings, and pass through a few uninhabited top-floor insulation layers to get downstairs, all to avoid being caught. Thinking back, it was quite dangerous. Plus, I've always been afraid of the dark. But for the sake of gaming, I was never scared crossing all those empty top floors. If you asked me to do it now, I wouldn't dare. I really admire my younger self!

![Snowy scene from my rooftop](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/image-20230429114622340.png)

After an all-nighter on Friday, I would sleep until noon and then go back to the internet cafe in the afternoon. On Sundays, I would basically play from 8 AM to 9 or 10 PM. I had so much energy back then. I never felt tired; in fact, I enjoyed it.

My final rank was two diamonds. Anyone who played back then knows how many games that took (it's easier to rank up now).

ps: I've been back to playing CF for almost a year now, and my current rank is Lieutenant Colonel 3 with two stars.

My grades were pretty bad back then. Let's put it this way: I was in a very ordinary county-level high school with about 500 students in my grade, and I was usually ranked around 280th. Moreover, I didn't study physics at all in eighth grade. I would just sleep in physics class and turn in blank exam papers.

Why was I so resistant to physics? It was because of a physics class early in the semester. The physics teacher mistakenly thought I was eating in class and arguing, so he slapped me. I held a grudge until college, thinking that one day I would beat up this physics teacher.

## Starting to Study in Ninth Grade

In the first semester of ninth grade, I suddenly had an awakening, as if a switch had been flipped. I realized I was about to go to high school and needed to start studying seriously.

Well, it wasn't exactly an awakening. The main reason was to be able to go to a school near my home, which would make it easier to get online. My home was near the local No. 2 High School, which had tons of internet cafes nearby, making it super convenient to play games. Plus, I could commute from home.

In my middle school, you basically had to be in the top 80 of the grade to have a chance of getting into No. 2 High School. Through hard work, in the first monthly exam of the first semester of ninth grade, I jumped from over 280th to over 50th in the grade, giving me a chance to get into No. 2 High School. Because of my significant improvement, I was named a **"Star of Progress"** and had to give a speech to the whole grade, sharing my experience. It was my first time speaking in front of so many people. I was nervous, but it felt great. I really showed off in front of my crush.

Actually, in ninth grade, my gaming addiction was still quite strong. However, I only played games after I had finished all my homework, and I paid relatively close attention in class.

In ninth grade, I pulled fewer all-nighters, but I would often sneak out at night after my family was asleep and play until after 2 AM before coming back.

At that time, our local high schools had a policy where outstanding students from each school could take an **early high school entrance exam**. If you passed, you didn't have to take the main high school entrance exam. I was lucky enough to take this exam and successfully got into our local No. 2 High School.

The night before my early high school entrance exam, I waited until my mom was asleep at midnight, then ran to the internet cafe to play CF until after 3 AM. That was the one time I got caught red-handed. When I got home, I found my mom sitting in the living room waiting for me. After a scolding, I promised never to sneak out at night again.

> A note here: I'm self-aware about my intelligence; it's pretty average. The main reason for my great progress was my solid foundation, especially in English and physics. I liked English, and I had learned a lot of the middle school English curriculum in elementary school. Physics was strange. Even though I didn't pay much attention in physics class in eighth grade and didn't know the subject, I suddenly got the hang of it in ninth grade. Really! I still find it strange now. Then, in high school, English and physics remained my two best subjects. When I worked as a tutor in college, I taught high school physics.

## Dropping from the Advanced Class to a Regular Class in High School

![A photo taken at my high school after the college entrance exam results came out](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/internet-addiction-teenager/wodegaozhong.png)

Because I took the early high school entrance exam, I started high school four months early in an advanced class, learning the high school curriculum.

After starting high school, I would secretly read novels in class. I read many novels like *Sealed Divine Throne*, *Douluo Dalu*, and *Battle Through the Heavens* during that time. When I went home at noon and in the evening, I would play a few rounds of DNF. My family had bought a computer by then, a gift from my grandpa for getting into No. 2 High School. By the time I uninstalled DNF, I had four max-level characters and two close to max level.

At that time, I had a dedicated album in my social media space filled with DNF photos and screenshots. I was obsessed with leveling up and running dungeons.

Less than a month into high school, I broke my leg during a PE class. It was the first time I felt the pain of a broken bone. It was excruciating!

So, I had to take a leave of absence to recover. I didn't go back to school until a month after high school officially started, and I missed the military training.

Because I had missed several months of classes, I couldn't rejoin the advanced class and had to transfer to the Olympiad class. In the Olympiad class, I continued to devote my time and energy to games and novels, so my grades were near the bottom. When the classes were reorganized in the second year of high school, I was successfully kicked out of the Olympiad class and placed in the most ordinary regular class.

**I successfully played my way from the best advanced class to the Olympiad class, and then to a regular class. A bit surreal, right?**

## Catching Up in My Sophomore Year

My high school awakening happened in the second semester of my sophomore year. I truly woke up then. Suddenly, games weren't appealing anymore. DNF wasn't fun. Killing monsters and getting gear was all just vanity. Having multiple max-level DNF accounts was useless. Without money, it was all for nothing.

My mom was quite surprised at the time and asked me strangely, "Why aren't you playing games anymore?" (My mom didn't really control my gaming; she believed it was a matter of self-discipline).

So, I started studying with all my might, immersing myself in my studies every day (no exaggeration), and I enjoyed it. Even though I got home around 11 PM after evening self-study, I didn't feel tired. Instead, I felt happy and fulfilled.

**My efforts quickly paid off, and I successfully returned to the Olympiad class.** At that time, there were about seven regular science classes, and each exam was ranked separately among them. The advanced and Olympiad classes were not ranked with us. After that, I was basically able to get first place in the regular classes every time, often leading the second place by about 30 points. Because my grades were quite impressive, I applied to the grade director to join the Olympiad class near the end of the first semester of my senior year.

## Insomnia Before the College Entrance Exam

> **After a failure, don't blame external factors. From beginning to end, it's your own problem. You're not strong enough!** Then, the insomnia before the college entrance exam was also my own problem. I can only blame myself; there are no other excuses.

My college entrance exam experience was quite rough. It's no exaggeration to say that those few days were probably the toughest time I've ever been through, especially at night.

I had insomnia every night during the college entrance exam. The pain of wanting to sleep but being unable to is something many people may have experienced.

Actually, I had never had insomnia before. On the eve of the exam, because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to sleep, I asked my mom to buy a few bottles of a calming and brain-boosting liquid recommended by my teacher. I still remember that this liquid was from the Aodong brand.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/internet-addiction-teenager/image-20220625194714247.png)

I think the insomnia during the exam might have been related to drinking the liquid recommended by the teacher, or maybe I was just too nervous. Because during those days, when I tried to sleep, it always felt like ants were crawling on my body, and I got some small pimples (a bit like an allergic reaction).

I need to make a special point here to avoid misunderstanding: **Insomnia itself is one's own problem. The above statement is not meant to blame the supplement.** Also, I checked various platforms for this calming and brain-boosting liquid and found that the reviews were quite good, similar to the reasons my teacher recommended it. If you need to improve your sleep, you can try it after consulting a doctor.

I really didn't perform well in the college entrance exam. I was in a daze in the exam hall. When the results came out, they were several tens of points lower than my own estimate. In the end, I only got into a non-prestigious university. However, I was lucky to have chosen a good major, benefited from the computer science boom, and worked hard during college.

## College Life

My college life was quite rich. I would occasionally pull all-nighters to code, and occasionally go out with classmates in the middle of the night to walk the ancient city walls or spend a night playing LOL at an internet cafe.

I wrote a separate article about my college life: [Sigh, It's Been Three Years Since Graduation!](./my-college-life.md).

## Conclusion

Throughout middle school, I was something of a gaming addict, though I restrained myself a bit in the ninth grade. It wasn't until the second semester of my sophomore year of high school that I truly wasn't so obsessed with games anymore.

The reason I became less addicted to games was that I realized that games are ultimately just a pastime, and studying was the most important thing at the time. Besides, my gaming skills weren't great, and I couldn't make a living from it. All the monster-slaying and leveling up were just binary data in a computer in the end.

**You have to realize this yourself. Otherwise, it's really hard to change just by relying on parental supervision! If your heart isn't in your studies, you can't possibly learn well!**

I'm really against parents interfering too much in their children's lives. I strongly condemn many parents who blame online games for their children's internet addiction and blame film and television for their children's violence.

**It's not a reliable thing to always protect your child. They will eventually have to face more and more temptations alone. By the time they get to college, many children who have been overprotected by their parents are completely lost. They have no sense of independence and no willpower to resist temptation!**
