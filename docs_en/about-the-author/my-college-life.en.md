> For my life in middle and high school, you can read the article I wrote in 2020: [I Used to Be a Gaming Addict](./internet-addiction-teenager.md).

I graduated in June 2019, and it has been three years since then. With the college entrance exams and graduation season upon us, I thought I'd briefly talk about my university life.

Here is the main text.

I graduated from Yangtze University, Jingzhou campus, a non-prestigious university.

The four years I spent there were quite happy, and I still miss them very much!

Overall, my life at university was quite colorful. I would occasionally pull all-nighters to code, and sometimes, in a fit of madness, I'd run out in the middle of the night with classmates to walk the ancient city walls or spend a whole night playing League of Legends at an internet cafe.

I'm writing this essay to document my past university life! I hope to continue moving forward and never forget why I started!

## Freshman Year

During my freshman year, I didn't focus my energy on learning to code; I spent most of my time in extracurricular activities.

Perhaps it was because I had come to a new city and was curious about everything around me. Or perhaps it was because I was still quite naive and had no clear direction for my studies.

That year, I explored many places in Jingzhou with a group of new classmates, such as the Jingzhou Museum, the Yangtze River Bridge, the former residence of Zhang Juzheng, and the Guan Di Temple.

![A freshman class outing](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/41239dd7d18642f7af201292ead94f1a~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

Even so, I was full of hope for the future and looked forward to life after graduation.

I still remember a time when my six roommates and I were chatting. The other five thought that finding a job with a salary of 6k would be great. I said, "It should be at least 8k!" They were speechless, thinking my idea was too naive.

Actually, in my heart, I was thinking of a starting salary of at least 10k per month, but I was too shy to say it out loud.

I don't like to be in the spotlight and am a bit introverted. When I first started university, I was a little insecure and hesitant in everything I did. I was eager to change myself!

So, with a burst of passion, I tried many things I had never tried before: **camping**, **outdoor barbecues**, **giving speeches on a bus**, **running around the ancient city wall**, **hiking**, **survival challenges in a strange place**, **selling apples at Christmas**, **performing at the New Year's Eve party**...

My club mates and I made these during our spare time, and they were almost all sold out during Christmas week. I remember, to sell more, we went door-to-door in every dorm to promote them.

I also participated in the freshman New Year's Eve party, but I was still holding back during that performance. To be honest, I feel I didn't perform as well as I should have.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/850cae1f8c644c5d920140f66ae9303d~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

After that performance, I realized I truly have no talent for performing; I'm very stiff. And this stiffness is something that I can't change even with effort.

The picture below was taken by a friend after I had a little too much to drink at a club dinner.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/82a503e365354bd1bf190540fbf1039a~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

Back then, I often went for night walks on the Jingzhou ancient city wall with a few friends from the club.

![A photo I took on the way to a night walk on the ancient city wall](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/007a83e6d26c43b9aa6e0b0266c3314b~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

I wonder how everyone from the club is doing now.

Although these experiences didn't directly help my future career and development, they made my university life more complete, filled with more interesting events and memorable experiences.

While my roommates were cooped up in the dorm playing games and on their phones, I'm glad I did these things.

Personally, I feel that participating in some good club activities and meeting like-minded friends during freshman year is a great thing!

**In addition to extracurricular activities, CS majors should try to develop good programming habits as early as possible, master a programming language, and practice algorithm problems in their spare time.**

### Running a Tutoring Center

During the summer of my freshman year, I was in charge of running five tutoring centers in the small towns of Xiaogan (originally seven, but two were cut).

From renting houses and desks to recruiting students, everything was started from scratch.

Every weekend, I would travel from Jingzhou to Xiaogan, running back and forth between various county towns. Most of the time, I was alone, but occasionally a few friends from the club would join me.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/6ee6358c236144d8a8a205cc6bc99b9b~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

I vividly remember that Xiaogan also had severe floods that year.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/javaguide/image-20210820201908759.png)

Once, I almost couldn't get back to school for my final exams. Although I hadn't prepared, I didn't fail any courses, and even did well in many subjects. However, this still had a significant impact on my GPA, causing me to miss out on scholarships later.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/3c5fe7af43ba4e348244df1692500fce~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

I was in a hurry this time, so I took a train back to school. On the train, I even bumped into someone else's suitcase!

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/570f5791aeb54fa1a76892b69e46fec2~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

When I was in the small towns, the worst place I stayed was a 15-yuan hotel. Yes, 15 yuan, you read that right. It was a small, dilapidated room in an old residential building, with no private bathroom, unsanitary bedding, and no shower.

The one below was the most luxurious place I stayed in. After taking a bus to Xiaogan, it suddenly started raining heavily, so I found a relatively cheap place near the station.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/687c3ede3f094c65a72d812ca0f06bb4~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

To rent a house at a lower price, I often haggled with landlords until I was red in the face.

To be honest, these were things I was unwilling to do. I'm someone who cares a lot about face and isn't very confident.

At that time, I had to travel between various towns, directly under the sun every day. Every meal was especially delicious; I could eat several bowls of rice with just a simple stir-fried vegetable.

I'm usually a picky eater, but this experience made me truly understand that when you're hungry, everything tastes good!

I cooked for six teachers, about ten students, and the landlords' families for over a month, and my cooking skills improved greatly as a result.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/2e3b6101abcd46a8a213c08782aeac33~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

These students were from elementary and middle school, and they were all quite obedient. Many were "left-behind children," whose parents worked elsewhere, leaving them with their grandparents.

Including me, there were four teachers in total. I mainly taught middle and high school physics.

The students were all well-behaved and never had any conflicts with us teachers. Only two mischievous elementary school students, after being reprimanded by me, held a grudge and wrote some things that I couldn't help but laugh at! Hahaha! So cute!

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/3680cead2c0f4165bb4865f038326b61~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

The night before we left, the teachers and I decided to invite some of the nearby students over for dinner. We went out early in the morning to buy groceries. The picture below is the finished meal. Although it was a simple meal, we ate with great relish.

![The last dinner at the tutoring center](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/f36bfd719b9b4463b2f1d3edc51faa97~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

That evening, a few parents even came over specifically to watch me cook. They said their children loved my cooking, hahaha! On the surface, I acted nonchalant and said my cooking wasn't good, but inside I was secretly pleased. I'm just a "covertly smug" person, hahaha!

I wonder how those students are doing now. I miss them!

When the tutoring session ended and I went home, my parents thought I had come back from a famine.

### Earning Money to Visit an Orphanage

At the end of my freshman year, I did something very meaningful. My friends and I visited an orphanage (Jingzhou Private Orphanage). This orphanage had been reported on by several TV stations and is now included in Baidu Baike.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/db8f5c276f4d4a7c9d7bd1e6100de301~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

Most of the children in the orphanage were either parentless or had been abandoned by their parents due to illness.

Before we went, we bought a lot of children's toys, stationery, and snacks. The source of this money was also meaningful; it was all money that my club mates and I had earned from part-time jobs.

![A group photo with the old gentleman who founded the orphanage before leaving](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/cf43853c49bd489a9fc0ee437a2af432~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted! To quote a line from the song "The Risk of Love": "If everyone gives a little love, the world will become a beautiful place."

I wanted to see the current situation of the orphanage, so I searched online and saw a report from Jingzhou News Network from last January.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/0ac27206389c498882dd7f6f440c6abb~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

In its 33 years of operation, the orphanage has raised 85 orphans, 5 of whom have joined the army to serve the country, and 20 have gone to university. Some have already started working and have families of their own.

The uncle is also getting older, with more and more white hair. It's a bit sad, I want to cry. I hope I have the chance to go back and see you again! I definitely will!

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/ea803a99c08149f892ca29e784653503~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

### Hiking

Another thing that left a deep impression on me during my freshman year was hiking.

A group of friends from the club and I hiked for nearly 45 kilometers. We walked from the west campus of our school to a beach in Zhijiang.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/94ca5b6c5ea84dfb9e12b7a718587ea3~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

It was truly all on foot. This was the first time I had ever walked so far.

By the time we reached our destination, my legs were no longer listening to me, and my feet were covered in blisters.

We camped on the beach, had a barbecue, sang and danced, and didn't start heading back to school until the next morning.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/8120d45d30254c908f9db20b3c00f514~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

## Sophomore Year

By my sophomore year, I began to shift my focus to learning programming.

However, I encountered a dilemma: my closest friends in the club wanted me to stay and lead the team with them to ensure the club's continuation.

But I had already planned what I wanted to do in my sophomore year and really wanted to focus my energy on learning to code and solidifying my technical skills.

Reluctantly, I eventually compromised and chose to lead the club with my friends. After all, true friends are hard to come by!

### Leading the Club

Leading a club indeed took up a lot of my spare time. Besides having to take a taxi from the east campus to the west campus every week to lead them in running, we also had to organize various activities for them frequently.

For example, we went to the banks of the Yangtze River for a barbecue and camping trip.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/8a6945ccc087017c1f96ee93f3af8178-20220608154206500.png)

And we also ran around the ancient city wall together.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/2cfba22049e8b99e11955bcb7662d790.png)

Back in university, I was very passionate about sports!

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/2dd503a60f814a7a953816bc3b5194cd~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

During my sophomore year, I had already run around the ancient city wall three times.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/949543b550e847d5a7314b7e1842489b~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

### Joining Changda Online

In my sophomore year, I also joined Changda Online, an organization under the university's Party Committee Propaganda Department. It was a tech-oriented group mainly responsible for creating websites, apps, and other things for the school.

You can still find an entry for Changda Online on Baidu.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/34ecf650120a4289a68b7549eb7d00cc~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

For some reason, I was even issued a press card, hahaha!

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/image-20220606121111042.png)

I chose the Android group and thus began my journey of learning Android development.

When I first joined this organization, I didn't even know what terms like HTML, CSS, JS, Java, or Linux meant.

Later on, I stayed on as a vice-director and continued to serve the organization for over half a year.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/image-20220608121413761.png)

### First Competition

At that time, I also enjoyed participating in some school competitions and won some good rankings. The one that impressed me the most was a PPT competition, which was also the first school competition I ever participated in.

Before the competition, I was a PPT novice. After studying hard for over a week, one of my works actually won first place.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/image-20220608121446529.png)

It was because of this competition that I got my first mechanical keyboard for free. This keyboard accompanied me through the rest of my university life.

### Deciding on a Technical Direction

At the end of the first semester of my sophomore year, I finally decided that my future technical direction would be Java backend. So, I started making a study plan and began my journey of leveling up in the Java backend field.

Every time I worked late and walked alone on campus, it felt great! I really liked that quiet feeling.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/336fd489ce314d259d6090194f237e1b~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

My physical fitness was really good back then. After staying up all night, I could get up as usual the next day for classes and study. Now, if I stay up late, I'm wiped out for the next two days!

By my junior year, I had gone through most of the essential technologies in the Java backend field and had also completed two practical projects using what I had learned.

Due to the lack of proper guidance, I took many detours while learning and wasted a lot of time (I envy you all for having me, so shameless!).

At that time, I was also quite narcissistic and liked to take selfies whenever I had nothing to do.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/image-20210820202341008.png)

During the National Day holiday, I didn't go home but stayed at school to watch Java videos and read books.

I remember being very efficient during that National Day holiday, and I was very motivated to study.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/WX20210820-203458.png)

## Junior Year

Throughout my junior year, I still had no weekends and almost no leisure time. Most of the time, I was studying alone in my dorm, and occasionally I would go to the library and the office.

Although my roommates often played games and watched dramas, it didn't affect me. Once I put on my headphones, it felt like the world was my own.

Unlike many experts, I was more efficient studying in my dorm than in the library or office.

### The Birth of JavaGuide

My open-source project JavaGuide and my public account were both launched this year.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/the-birth-of-javaguide.jpeg)

Currently, JavaGuide has reached 100k stars, and my public account has over 150k followers.

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/image-20210820211926742.png)

### Earning Money from Freelance Work

Some opportunities also allowed me to take on some freelance work to earn money this year. To ensure timely delivery, I would occasionally stay up late. At that time, I was still happy and fulfilled even when pulling all-nighters. Every time I thought about earning money through my skills, I felt very motivated.

I have also written an article sharing my experience with freelance work: [Let's Chat! I Earned 30k+ from Freelance Work in College](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2OTA0Njk0OA==&mid=2247499539&idx=1&sn=ff153f9bd98bb3109b1f14e58ed9a785&chksm=cea1b0d8f9d639cee4744f845042df6b1fc319f4383b87eba76a944c2648c81a51c28d25e3b6&token=2114015135&lang=zh_CN#rd).

However, the freelance projects I took on were quite varied and not very suitable as project experience for my resume.

So, to make my resume's project experience look better, I found two projects to do myself. One was a mall-type project that I followed along with a video tutorial. The other was a video website-type project that I created based on my own ideas.

The approximate architecture of the mall-type project is as follows (I couldn't find the original diagram I drew at the time):

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/206fab84bf5b4c048f8a88bc68c942f6~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

At that time, mall projects seemed to be everywhere and were widely used. To make my mall project more competitive, after following the video tutorial, I added many of my own elements, such as replacing the message queue ActiveMQ with Kafka and adding a second-level cache.

During the summer vacation, I also worked with classmates and a teacher on a real enterprise project for employee performance management. This project was very, very similar to the project I worked on when I first joined my company, although the company's version was probably more advanced and the code quality was higher. What a coincidence!

I remember encountering many problems when I was working on projects independently. **Often, things that are easy to understand when you read them in a book will present small problems when you try to implement them. I usually solved these problems through Google searches. Using a search engine well can really solve 99% of your problems.**

### Participating in a Software Design Competition

There was a regret in my junior year. I participated in a software design competition with a few like-minded friends. The system we spent nearly two months building successfully made it to the semi-finals.

However, I later quit because I personally felt that spending more time on this system wouldn't teach me much and would be a waste of time. Then, the whole team disbanded.

Actually, looking back now, I could have learned something. My mindset at the time was a bit arrogant and overly ambitious.

Thinking about it now, I still feel quite sorry for the friends who worked hard with me late into the night.

Life is like that. It's a long journey, and whenever you look back at your past self, you will definitely have regrets.

### Giving Up on Graduate School

At that time, I also struggled with whether to pursue a master's degree. After all, my university was just average, and a master's degree could certainly add some value and improve my academic credentials.

However, I ultimately gave up on the idea of graduate school. I was quite confident at the time and felt that I could find a good job without a master's degree.

### Internship

In my junior year, I also found an internship at a company not far from the school, founded by an alumnus. But to be honest, the overall internship experience was very poor. Not only did I not learn much, but it also delayed many of my planned tasks.

I remember that many projects at this company were still using JSP, and the technology was very old. It would have been fine if they were old projects, but I saw that projects started just a few months ago were still using JSP, which was just ridiculous...

It was really tough at the time. They wanted you to start working as soon as you arrived, the workload was huge, and if you couldn't finish, they wanted you to work overtime for free...

There was nothing I could do at the time because I couldn't find any other companies in Jingzhou for an internship, and I couldn't go to another city for one. This is one of the problems that comes with choosing a university not in a first or second-tier city.

## 大四

### 开始找工作

找实习找工作时候，才知道大学所在的城市的重要性。

由于，我的学校在荆州，而且本身学校就很一般，因此，基本没有什么比较好的企业来招人。

当时，唯一一个还算可以的就是苏宁，不过，我遇到的那个苏宁的 HR 还挺恶心的，第一轮面试的时候就开始压薪资了，问我能不能加班。然后，我也就对苏宁没有了想法。

秋招我犯了一个比较严重的问题，那就是投递简历开始的太晚。我是把学校的项目差不多做完之后，才开始在网上投递简历。这个时候，暑假差不多已经结束了，秋招基本已经尾声了。

可能也和学校环境有一些关系，当时，身边的同学没有参加秋招的。大三暑假的时候，都跑去搞学院组织的实习。我是留在学校做项目，没有去参加那次实习。

我觉得学校还是非常有必要提醒学生们把握住秋招这次不错的机会的！

在网上投递了一些简历之后，很多笔试我觉得做的还可以的都没有回应。

我有点慌了！于是，我就从荆州来到武汉，想在武大华科这些不错的学校参加一些宣讲会。

到了武汉之后，我花了一天时间找了一个蛋壳公寓住下。第二天，我就跑去武汉理工大学参加宣讲会。

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/image-20210820204919942.png)

当天，我就面试了自己求职过程中的第一家公司—**玄武科技**。

就是这样一家中小型的公司，当时来求职面试的很多都是武大华科的学生。不过，他们之中一定有很多人和我一样，就是单纯来刷一波经验，找找信心。

整个过程也就持续了 3 天左右，我就顺利的拿下了玄武科技的 offer。不过，最终没有签约。

### 拿到 Offer

来武汉之前，我实际上已经在网上投递了 **ThoughtWorks**，并且，作业也已经通过了。

当时，我对 ThoughtWorks 是最有好感的，内心的想法就是：“拿下了 ThoughtWorks，就不再面试其他公司了”。

奈何 ThoughtWorks 的进度太慢，担心之余，才来武汉面试其他公司留个保底。

不过，我最终如愿以偿获得了 ThoughtWorks 的 offer。

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/about-the-author/college-life/9ad97dcc5038499b96239dd826c471b7~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image.png)

面试 ThoughtWorks 的过程就不多说了，我在[《结束了我短暂的秋招，说点自己的感受》](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2OTA0Njk0OA==&mid=2247484842&idx=1&sn=4489dfab0ef2479122b71407855afc71&chksm=cea24a61f9d5c3774a8ed67c5fcc3234cb0741fbe831152986e5d1c8fb4f36a003f4fb2f247e&scene=178&cur_album_id=1323354342556057602#rd)这篇文章中有提到。

## A Few Suggestions

Here are a few of my own suggestions. Although I'm not outstanding, you can certainly be better:

1.  **Determine your direction.** Figure out if you want to go to graduate school or find a job. If you want to go to graduate school, take every potential exam subject seriously. You should also code in your spare time and preferably complete a project, which will help with your interview and skill improvement. If you're looking for a job, determine your direction as early as possible, have a plan, and understand your strengths and weaknesses.
2.  **Start learning with a job-oriented mindset as early as possible.** This approach is more targeted, can significantly reduce time spent in confusion, and help you avoid many detours.
3.  **Self-study is very important.** Develop the habit of self-learning and learn how to learn.
4.  **Don't think that skipping class makes you a bad student.** I skipped many classes in university. Most of the time I spent skipping class was used to learn things I felt were more important. The classes I skipped were mostly unimportant and wouldn't affect my graduation.
5.  **University relationships are relatively pure.** If you meet someone suitable, try to get to know them. If someone doesn't like you, don't pester them; you can't force these things. You have to admit that the desire to get to know someone often starts with their appearance, not their interesting soul.
6.  **Manage your physique.** Go for a run when you have time. Don't become a "greasy" guy.
7.  **Don't place too much importance on GPA.** I think GPA has a negligible effect on job hunting and graduate school applications, although not failing courses is important. However, GPA does carry the most weight in scholarship selections and recommendations for graduate school admission.
8.  **Don't be too utilitarian.** Don't expect everything you do or learn to bring immediate benefits. Persistence and a utilitarian mindset are often inversely proportional.
9.  ...

## Afterword

It's inevitable to encounter credential barriers during the job search, especially for those of us from average universities. I don't think this is unfair; if there's anyone to blame, it's ourselves for not getting into a better school.

**Considering recruitment costs and time, companies are definitely more willing to select talent from better universities.**

I used to complain about not being in a 211 or 985 university. But, upon reflection, it was my own issue for not getting into one. Besides, in the field of computer science, academic qualifications are relatively more meritocratic compared to other majors.

There are plenty of people around me who graduated from junior colleges or third-tier universities and got into major tech companies. This isn't just a feel-good story to encourage friends from less prestigious schools.

**Act more, complain less.**
