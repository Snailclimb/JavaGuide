On **December 29, 2019**, after about a year of hesitation, I officially decided to start my own Planet to help students learning Java and preparing for Java interviews. In the blink of an eye, more than four years have passed. Thank you all for your companionship along the way. I will keep my promise to continue to seriously maintain this pure Java Knowledge Planet and not disappoint the readers who trust me.

I was one of the earlier tech bloggers to create a Planet, and I am also one of the few who have persisted (most bloggers just cash in and abandon their Planets). For the first year or two, it was purely a labor of love. The initial pricing was very low (the cost of a meal), and since I was busy with my new job, the services offered were not as extensive as they are now.

Gradually, as the price increased, the Planet's income also slowly grew. However, considering that my audience is mainly students, the pricing is still much lower than similar Planets. Additionally, I have no plans to create a training camp, even though a training camp could make me more money given my traffic.

**I have my principles: no get-rich-quick schemes, create content with heart, and genuinely hope to help others!**

## What is a Knowledge Planet?

Simply put, a Knowledge Planet is a private communication circle, mainly used by knowledge creators to connect with their most loyal readers/fans. Compared to WeChat groups, Knowledge Planet is more efficient for content retention and information management.

## What can my Knowledge Planet offer you?

I strive to create the highest quality Java interview communication Planet! After joining my Planet, you will get:

1.  Permanent access to 6 high-quality columns covering interviews, source code analysis, practical projects, and more!
2.  Free access to multiple original PDF interview manuals.
3.  Free resume review services (having helped over 7,000 members so far).
4.  One-on-one free Q&A sessions (exclusive advice, heartfelt answers).
5.  Exclusive job-hunting guides and suggestions to help you avoid detours and double your efficiency!
6.  A massive collection of high-quality Java interview resources.
7.  Check-in activities, book clubs, and study groups, so you no longer have to learn alone.
8.  Occasional benefits: holiday prize draws, book and course giveaways, offline member meetups, and more.
9.  ...

Any one of these services alone is worth far more than the Planet's admission fee.

Here is a **30** yuan exclusive coupon for the Planet, limited quantity (price will be increasing soon. Renewals for existing users are half price; you can renew by scanning the QR code with WeChat)!

### Resume Review

During interview season, I review at least 15-30 resumes on an average night. Outside of interview season, the number of requests is slightly lower. Otherwise, it would be truly overwhelming!

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/xingqiu/image-20220304123156348.png)

A quick count shows that I have provided free resume review services to at least **7,000+** members to date.

I provide detailed suggestions for each resume, revising them with care, and have received high praise!

### One-on-One Q&A

You can have one-on-one free Q&A sessions with me, and I will answer your questions thoughtfully. To date, I have answered **3,000+** questions from readers.

### Study Check-ins

The Planet's study check-in activities encourage you to learn and communicate with other members.

You can also learn from other members' check-ins. Most importantly, this learning atmosphere is very helpful for self-discipline!

### Reading Activities

We regularly hold reading activities (with generous rewards), where I lead everyone to read some excellent technical books!

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/xingqiu/image-20220211233642079.png)

The prize-winning rate for each reading activity is very, very, very high! The value directly exceeds the admission fee!!!

### Irregular Benefits

From time to time, I give away books, columns, and red envelopes on the Planet. There are many benefits.

## 是否收费？

星球是需要付费才能进入的。 **为什么要收费呢？**

1. 维护好星球是一件费时费力的事情，每到面试季，我经常凌晨还在看简历和回答球友问题。市面上单单一次简历修改服务也至少需要 200+，而简历修改也只是我的星球提供的服务的冰山一角。除此之外，我还要抽时间写星球专属的一些专栏，单单是这些专栏的价值就远超星球门票了。
2. 星球提供的服务比较多，如果我是免费提供这些服务的话，是肯定忙不过来的。付费这个门槛可以帮我筛选出真正需要帮助的那批人。
3. 免费的东西才是最贵的，加入星球之后无任何其他需要付费的项目，统统免费！
4. 合理的收费是对我付出劳动的一种正向激励，促进我继续输出！同时，这份收入还可以让我们家人过上更好的生活。虽然累点，但也是值得的！

另外，这个是一年的，到明年这个时候结束，差不过够用了。如果服务结束的时候你还需要星球服务的话，可以添加我的微信（**javaguide1024**）领取一个续费优惠卷，半价基础再减 10，记得备注 **“续费”** 。

## 如何加入？

这里赠送一个 **30** 元的星球专属优惠券吧，数量有限（价格即将上调。老用户续费半价 ，微信扫码即可续费）！
