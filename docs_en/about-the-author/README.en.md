In this article, I will briefly introduce myself through a Q&A format.

## When did I graduate?

Many long-time readers probably know that I graduated with my bachelor's degree in 2019 and went straight to "retire" at a foreign company.

My academic background is quite poor. I performed poorly on the college entrance exam, barely scoring 20 points above the cutoff for first-tier universities, and ended up at a very ordinary, non-prestigious university in Jingzhou. However, I'm glad I didn't give up on myself because of my school. Instead, I worked harder than most of my peers, and my university life was quite fulfilling.

Here is a graduation photo taken at the time (I'm in the middle of the back row):

## How long have I been blogging?

Time flies! I started blogging in my sophomore year. Back then, I would casually post my study notes and the programs I wrote on blog platforms. For example, the article [Summary of "Computer Networks" by Mr. Xie Xiren](../cs-basics/network/computer-network-xiexiren-summary.md) was something I put together from the textbook while taking the computer networks course in my sophomore year.

Many friends around me often ask, "Is it too late for me to start blogging now?"

I think that if you want to do something, you should ask less about whether it's too late and more about whether it's worth it. As long as you feel it's meaningful, just start doing it as soon as possible! Life is wonderful. Every major decision we make affects the trajectory of our future lives. Whether it's for the better or worse, only we will know!

For me, the decision to stick with blogging has had a very positive impact on my life's trajectory! So, I also recommend that everyone develop the habit of blogging regularly.

## How much money did I earn during university?

During my time at university, I earned over 200,000 RMB through running tutoring classes, taking on freelance projects, providing technical training, and participating in programming competitions, successfully achieving "financial independence." I used the money I earned to travel to places like Chongqing, Sanya, Enshi, and Qingdao. I also contributed a lot to my family, reducing my parents' burden.

This photo was taken during my freshman year when I was running a tutoring class (the last meal before leaving):

This photo was taken when I went to Sanya in my junior year:

Actually, the main reason I started working so hard to earn money in university was because my family's financial situation was very average, and my parents worked very hard to make money. It was precisely because I urgently wanted to lighten my parents' burden that I tried so many ways to earn money.

I've found that many people in our profession as programmers come from average family backgrounds. A big reason for choosing this industry is not because they love it, but to earn more money.

If you also want to make money through freelance projects, you can reply with "**freelance**" in my public account's backend to get some of my personal experience sharing.

## Why do I call myself Guide?

It's probably because my project is named JavaGuide, which led many people to call me **Brother Guide**.

Later, to make it easier for readers to address me, I changed my pen name to **Guide**.

My early pen name for writing articles was SnailClimb. Many people don't know what this name means, but it becomes clear if you break it down. SnailClimb = Snail + Climb. I've been a big fan of Jay Chou's songs since I was a child, especially his song "Snail" 🐌. Also, I performed rather poorly on my college entrance exam, but after starting university, I was quite the "aspiring youth." So, I gave myself the pen name SnailClimb, which means I must keep climbing upwards, hehe 😁

## Afterword

Follow your heart, travel light. Life is an adverse journey, sail with a single reed.

Life is a mix of bitter and sweet. Let's encourage each other!
