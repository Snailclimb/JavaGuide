It's hard to believe it's been over a month since I started. Before this, I had never interned or worked at a company, so many things were quite new to me. The transition from school to the workplace brings a change in roles, and the differences vary from person to person. For me, in school, I could selectively absorb what the teacher taught based on my interests, and I could even skip classes I didn't want to attend. It's different at a company. You have to learn the skills the company requires, unless you want to quit. In school, most people code to pass exams or find a good job; very few are driven by genuine interest. In the workplace, we code more because of job requirements, which is generally more challenging and stressful than in school. In school, our main responsibility is to ourselves, constantly learning to arm ourselves with knowledge. But at a company, we are responsible not only to ourselves but also to the company. After all, the company is paying you, not for you to be "on the beach."

When I first joined the company, I switched to a Mac computer as required. Since I had always used Windows, I was very uncomfortable with it. I was clumsy at first and felt my programming efficiency drop by at least 30%. I was quite frustrated and often complained to myself about why we couldn't just use Windows or Linux. But strangely, after about a week, I slowly started to get used to programming on a Mac and even grew to like it. I don't want to compare the programming experience of Mac and Windows here; I think it varies from person to person. For the same price, a Mac's hardware specs are indeed a few steps behind Windows. However, the programming and user experience on a Mac are excellent. Of course, you can also choose to use Linux for daily development, which I believe would be great. Also, you can't play some mainstream online games on a Mac, which is a good choice for friends who can't resist the temptation to play games.

I have to say that ThoughtWorks' training program is very good. Graduates are usually scheduled for training after joining. Unlike previous years, this year's training included a local China class (TWU-C). As a member of the first local class, I can honestly say it was great. The 8-week training, in addition to basic technologies needed for work like ES6 and SpringBoot, also included training on essential skills for new employees, such as how to hold efficient meetings, how to give proper feedback, how to refactor code, how to practice TDD, and so on. There were also regular activities during the training, such as Weekend Trips, City Tours, Cake Time, etc. The last three weeks included a simulated real-world project, which was very similar to the actual projects we work on, and I found it to be a great experience. This project has now completed one iteration, and I feel that the biggest takeaway was not the technology used, but how to collaborate as a team, how to use Git for team development, what a complete iteration looks like, what problems might be encountered during a project, and the entire workflow of a project.

ThoughtWorks strongly encourages sharing and helping others grow, and I have felt this deeply during my time at the company. During the training, each of us had a Trainer who was responsible for our daily classes and projects. One Trainer was responsible for about 5-6 people. The Trainers regularly gave us feedback on our recent performance. I don't think this was just a formality; the Trainers were very responsible and often chatted with us after work. Colleagues are also very enthusiastic. If you have a problem and ask someone, they will usually tell you everything they know without reservation. If it's a problem that most people don't understand, they might even organize a technical session to share knowledge. Last Friday, I gave a technical sharing session in our group about Feign remote calls because the team was not very familiar with this topic, but it was likely to be used in future project development. I had just researched this topic, so I shared it with other colleagues in the group to help the project proceed more smoothly.

In addition, ThoughtWorks is a company that strongly advocates a feedback culture. Feedback is about telling people our opinion of their performance and how they can do better. At first, I didn't pay much attention to it, but gradually I realized that giving proper feedback can be very helpful to others. This is because when people are doing things, it's hard for them to notice small problems that are obvious to others. For example, there's an interesting phenomenon: if you don't have a tester role in your project, and you've completed your module and tested it many times yourself, you might think there are no problems. However, when it's actually used, problems you never noticed before are very likely to appear. The explanation for this is that everyone has blind spots in their vision, which are closely related to our focus. We often can't find many problems in our own work even after testing it many times, but if we ask someone else to test it for us, they are very likely to find many obvious issues.

After starting work, I have less time to update my public account, columns, and maintain my GitHub. In fact, many times after work, I have my own time to do my own things, but I always make excuses like being too tired from work or having fragmented time. Today, I looked at GitHub and suddenly realized that I hadn't handled a PR that someone submitted to me 14 days ago. This is indeed something I haven't done well; I haven't managed my time properly. I actually have a lot of things I want to write, and I will gradually put them on the agenda. After starting work, I've realized how important it is to spend the few hours after work. If you feel you haven't finished your work during the day, you can continue working on it after you get off work. If you can handle your daytime work with ease, you can do things you are interested in and learn technologies you are interested in after you get home. Do everything based on your own foundation, and don't aim too high.

After starting work, I am also surrounded by many talented people. I think every professional should learn from others. Among the colleagues who trained with us this time, some are very skilled technically, while others may not be as strong technically but have excellent organizational and teamwork skills. There is a particularly brilliant colleague who, while we were still learning the various syntaxes of SpringBoot, wrote a simplified version of SpringBoot in his spare time, covering some common Spring annotations like `@RestController`, `@Autowired`, `@PathVariable`, `@RequestParam`, and so on (I have already contacted this colleague and asked him to open-source it, and I will share it on my public account as soon as possible, so look forward to it!). I think this colleague has a real interest in programming. He seems to have started programming in junior high school and is very interested in various underlying knowledge. He has written and implemented many low-level things himself. His dream is to create a project with over 20k stars on GitHub. I believe that with his abilities, he will definitely achieve this goal. I wish him all the best and hope he can achieve this goal soon.

These are my personal feelings after more than a month of work. Many parts are just touched upon briefly. I will take the time to share more useful knowledge I have learned at the company or in my spare time with you all. I hope everyone who reads it can gain something.
