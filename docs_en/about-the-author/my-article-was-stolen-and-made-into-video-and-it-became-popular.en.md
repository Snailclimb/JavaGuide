Back on 2021-02-25, when I was browsing Bilibili, I discovered that a certain UP owner of Bilibili (a training institution) made one of my answers on Zhihu into a video without permission.

Original taste! Fuck. I even added the self-deprecation I made at the beginning! Real cowhide!

If you steal my original work, you can just put your heart into making the video better! At least we can spread such high-quality content!

As a result, my dear, the video was made like shit, and the dubbing was also inappropriate!

Please, after reading this article, this training institution can consider changing someone to do similar disgusting things! This person has no brain at all!

I randomly found a video to watch, and found that it was still someone else's original work.

There is no need to read the other videos. Everyone should know whether they are still plagiarizing other people’s original works and making them into videos intact.

They do this for one purpose: to divert traffic to their own QQ group, and then trick you into buying courses. **

I don't think this is entirely a problem with the training institutions. Employees of training institutions do such disgusting things for the sake of traffic, which has led to this kind of thing happening more and more frequently.

Therefore, you will find that there are more and more small accounts from training institutions on Bilibili and Zhihu, plagiarizing original works and stealing content everywhere.

Articles written by many original account owners around me are often stolen by some training institutions.

Sometimes I get really angry because after all, your hard work is original, and someone else just copies and pastes it and it goes to waste!

However, I believe that this kind of behavior of plagiarizing other people's original works to attract traffic is just the behavior of a clown after all!

Only those creators who output content carefully can go further and be more stable!

Later, I posted an article on my official account titled ["Good guy! A training institution stole my article and made it into a video, which became a hit.” m=cea18f2ef9d606384e0265b9318e004646c03b8a69f2801698d2f9e0e6bdfec0a1185ac3ab17&token=2146952532&lang=zh_CN&scene=21#wechat_redirect) article, complaining that his original work was used for free by an organization.

Who would have thought that people from the training institution would find someone to ask me to delete the article! To be honest, these two people are really weird!

Do you want me to have a bigger picture? Fuck you! It's obviously my original work, but instead of deleting it yourself, you asked someone to contact me to delete it! Do you have any brains?

In fact, I am a person who is relatively easy to talk to, and I am also known for my good temper in real life (provided that my principles are not violated).

What’s funny! While they asked me to delete the article, the videos they had stolen from Station B were still there, and they continued to attract traffic to them.

If they cancel the account, I might consider letting it go. However, the article will definitely not be deleted.

Now, let’s see what happens next! I can use the law to protect my rights at any time, it just depends on whether I want to, after all, it is quite troublesome, right?

Don't worry, it's all a trivial matter. My girlfriend is studying law at a double first-class law school in China.

We are not afraid of trouble! Damn! ! !
