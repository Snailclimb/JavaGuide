2021-03-21, at 12 o'clock in the evening, after finishing a certain front-end function of a project I was working on, I opened [my GitHub homepage](https://github.com/Snailclimb).

Good guy! I didn’t notice it for a few days, but the [JavaGuide](https://github.com/Snailclimb/JavaGuide) project directly reached 100K stars.

![JavaGuide 100k milestone](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/1&e=1643644799&token=kIxbL07-8jAj8w1n4s9zv64FuZZNEATmlU_Vm6zD:zANqh9HQEvvLPm6smyrjvjAt-Ik=.png)

Actually, there's really nothing to complain about. Because the value of tutorials is actually relatively low, and the number of stars is relatively large mainly because the audience is relatively broad. Everyone thinks it is good, and clicking a star is equivalent to collecting it. For many particularly excellent frameworks, the number of stars may only be a few K. Therefore, simply looking at the number of stars is meaningless, just treat it as a joke!

In the process of maintaining this project, some people also dissed it: "The md project has no gold content and is an embarrassment to the Chinese people!".

For people who say this kind of thing, I don’t think it has any impact on me, so I will continue to improve and make JavaGuide better! In fact, many foreign projects are also pure MD! For example, the awesome series and job interview series launched by foreign friends. No need to say more, actions speak for themselves! Damn!

A very important aspect of open source is collaboration. If you open source a project and then no longer maintain it, and others submit issues/prs to you but you don’t handle it, then open source means nothing!

The friends on my official account all follow me through this project. Taking advantage of my lunch break, I can briefly review it, which can be considered responsible for the friends who follow this project.

When I started preparing for the fall recruitment interview in my junior year, I created the JavaGuide project. On **2018-05-07**, I submitted the **first commit** on this day.

As of today (2021-03-23), this warehouse has accumulated **2933** commits, and a total of **207** friends have participated in the project.

There are **511** **issues** and **575** **PR** in total. All PRs have been taken care of, and there are only about 15 issues that I haven't gotten around to yet.

In fact, compared to the number of stars, the issues and PRs in the warehouse can better illustrate whether your project is valuable.

I won’t go into details about the behavior of people cheating on stars or even getting stars, it’s a bit embarrassing. If people think your project is good and can provide value, they will naturally give you stars.

**In the next few years, I will continue to improve JavaGuide. **

**I hope I can open source some valuable wheels in the future! Keep up the good work! **
