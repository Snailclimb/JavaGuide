## Shortcut to growth

- It is good to have a humble attitude at the beginning of employment, but do not use "I am a newbie" as a psychological safety line;
- Writing a technical blog takes about two weeks, but it may be the fastest way to grow;
- Be sure to read two books: The Pyramid Principle and The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People (the name of this book is like Success Learning, but it actually talks about how to build character);
- Ask more about what and why, go back to the source and solve the problem. The problem you are trying to avoid will always be waiting for you at the next intersection;
- Don’t indulge in the false sense of security brought by busyness. The most real security is the determination and pursuit of goals;
- Don’t worry too much about temporary gains and losses. In a fair environment, suffering a loss is a blessing, not chicken soup;
- Don’t limit your thinking and skills to roles such as front-end, back-end, and testing, and position yourself as the terminator of business domain problems;
- Curiosity and love are the biggest shortcuts to growth. Long-termists will recognize the value of their work, even higher than the current recognition (KPI) given by the organization.

## Kungfu in daily life

- Each line of code should represent your current highest level. Small details that you think don’t matter may be hidden arrows that hurt you in the promotion field;
- The biweekly report is not a work diary. Don’t be pushed by time. At the very least, you must know what will be in the next biweekly report (driven by small goals);
- If you feel that your daily routine is filled with trivial work, unskilled work, doing chores for seniors, etc., you can try to classify the things at hand, and imagine that each category is a small grid, and the end point of these grids is your goal. In this way, every day is no longer a mechanical requirement, but a planned filling in the grid, working hard for the goal, and even adding requirements to yourself, because you can clearly see where you want to go;
- Daily words and deeds are a microscope of ability. Most people may not realize that their strength and weakness are so obvious. Don't try to cover it up needlessly, let alone get away with it.

> The last one probably means that sometimes we care about our performance in the spotlight (duty reports, promotions, weekly reports, reports, etc.), thinking that everyone will evaluate ourselves based on this. In fact, how everyone completes business needs, helps classmates around them, and creates value on a daily basis is the basis for everyone to evaluate themselves. And what kind of characteristics each person has, partners who have worked with them three times can accurately evaluate them. Performances in the spotlight can only deceive themselves.

## Learn to be managed

> Superiors and supervisors generally refer to it, and development counterparts such as PD supervisors are also within the scope.

- Don’t spread negative emotions and don’t always complain;
- It is easier to gain respect by being neither humble nor arrogant to your superiors, but do not refute each other's views in public and communicate differences in private;
- Do a good job in upward management, especially in aligning expectations and communicating about performance surprises. Both parties are actually responsible, but you are the one who is unlucky;
- Try to think from the perspective of a supervisor:

- - In this way, many decisions that seemed unbelievable in the past can be understood;
  - Don’t care about who performs, who gets the credit, etc. The importance of sharing the team’s worries and winning the trust of the supervisor is far higher than these;
  - Don’t understand this principle as supremacy, which is the most disgusting thing.

## Thinking transformation

- Defining problems is a high-level ability. Form a closed loop of thinking as early as possible: discover problems -> define problems -> solve problems -> eliminate problems;
- Be value-oriented, do things results-oriented, and talk about things problem-oriented;
- I can’t explain clearly, but most likely it’s not because I am a practical person, but because I haven’t thought clearly about it, which is more obvious in the promotion field;
- When a person is good at solving problems in a certain scene, he may become more and more inseparable from this scene as time goes by (it is difficult to be labeled with a label, and it is even harder to tear off a label).

## Keep emotions in check

- Learn to control your emotions, no one will listen carefully to what an angry person is saying;
- No matter how wronged or angry you are, you must remain rational and don’t let yourself become the kind of person who needs to be coaxed;
- Only those who are confident enough will admit their problems frankly. Many times we are irritated just because the other person pointed out our deep self-esteem;
- What hurts us most is neither what others do nor our own mistakes, but our response to them.

## Become a Leader

> Managers have subordinates, and Leaders have followers. You don’t need many managers, but everyone can be a Leader.

- The person who convinces you and is willing to follow you is not the manager in his position, but the person who helps you. The same is true if you want to convince others;
- Don’t make negative comments about people easily. Evaluations based on one-sided knowledge may be inaccurate, and inadvertent spreading will cause great trouble to the other party;
- Leaders will have a particularly painful life if they do not agree with the company’s mission, vision, and values;
- Don’t deny your teammates when times are difficult, and give more timely and positive feedback;
- The most important thing for a captain is not to build a ship, but to inspire sailors' yearning for the sea;
- The leader’s natural responsibility is to keep the team alive. The only way is to achieve the goals of superiors, bosses, and company operators. The more difficult the time, the more obvious it becomes;
- The leader's important responsibility is to identify what the team needs to do, and to strengthen the belief so that everyone can do it. The more difficult the time, the more determined it is;
- A leader should make everyone he meets feel important and needed.
