Many times, due to work reasons, we need to quickly learn a certain technology and then apply it in the project. In other words, the company we want to interview requires a certain technology that we have not been exposed to before. In order to cope with the interview needs, we need to master this technology quickly.

As a programmer who is purely self-taught, this article briefly talks about my views on how to quickly learn a certain technology.

When learning any technology, you must first understand what problem the technology is designed to solve. Before studying this technology in depth, you must first understand this technology from a global perspective, think about what modules it is composed of, what functions it provides, and what advantages it must have over similar technologies.

For example, when we are learning Spring, through Spring's official documents you can know the latest technical trends of Spring, what modules Spring contains, and what problems Spring can help you solve.

For another example, when I am learning about message queues, I will first understand what role this message queue generally plays in the system and what problems it helps us solve. There are many types of message queues. When I study a specific message queue, I will compare it with the message queues I have already studied. When I was learning RocketMQ myself, I would first compare it with ActiveMQ, the first message queue I had ever studied, and think about what improvements RocketMQ had compared to ActiveMQ, what pain points it solved for ActiveMQ, what similarities and differences there were between the two.

**The most effective and fastest way to learn a technology is to connect this technology with the technology you have learned before to form a network. **

Then, I suggest that you first read the tutorials in the official documentation, run the relevant Demo, and do some small projects.

However, official documents are usually in English, and usually only domestic projects and a small number of foreign projects provide Chinese documents. Moreover, the introduction in official documents is often rough and not suitable for beginners as learning materials.

If you don’t understand the official website’s documentation, you can also search for relevant keywords to find some high-quality blogs or videos to watch. **Be sure not to understand the principles of this technology right from the beginning. **

For example, when we are learning the Spring framework, I suggest that after you understand the problems that the Spring framework solves, you do not directly start studying the principles or source code of the Spring framework, but first actually experience the core functions provided by the Spring framework, IoC (Inverse of Control: Inversion of Control) and AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming: Aspect-oriented programming), use the Spring framework to write some demos, or even use the Spring framework to do some small projects.

In a nutshell, **Before studying the principles of this technology, you must first understand how this technology is used. **

Such a step-by-step learning process can gradually help you build the pleasure of learning, gain an immediate sense of accomplishment, and avoid being discouraged from directly studying theoretical knowledge.

**When studying a certain technical principle, in order to avoid the content being too abstract, we can also practice it. **

For example, when we were learning the principles of Tomcat, we found that Tomcat's custom thread pool is quite interesting. Then we can also handwrite a customized version of the thread pool ourselves. Another example is when we learn the Dubbo principle, we can build a simple version of the RPC framework by ourselves.

In addition, there are actually some differences between the technologies that need to be used in learning projects and those that need to be used in interviews.

If you are learning a certain technology to use it in actual projects, then your focus is to learn the use of this technology and best practices, and understand the problems that may be encountered during the use of this technology. Your ultimate goal is that the technology brings real results to the project, and that the results are positive.

If you are learning a certain technology just for the interview, then your focus should be on some of the most common questions about this technology in the interview, which is what we often call the eight-part essay.

Many people look down upon it when it comes to Eight-Part Part Essay. In my opinion, if you don't memorize eight-part essays by rote, but think about the essence of these interview questions. In the process of preparing eight-part essays, you can also deepen your understanding of this technology.

Finally, the most important and difficult thing is the unity of knowledge and action! Unity of knowledge and action! Unity of knowledge and action! ** Whether it is programming or other fields, the most important thing is not how much you know, but to try to integrate knowledge with action.
