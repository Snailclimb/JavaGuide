title: What should I do if I don’t have internship experience in school recruitment?

Since the current interviews are too lengthy, for students who are hesitant about looking for an internship, I personally suggest that both undergraduates and graduate students should seek good internship opportunities before participating in campus recruitment interviews, especially internship opportunities in large factories, whether daily internships or summer internships. Of course, if internships in large factories are not available, internships in small and medium-sized factories are also acceptable.

However, it is really hard to find internships now. There are a lot of students who failed to find internships this year, and some of them are even students from 211/985 prestigious schools.

If we really can’t find a suitable internship, there’s nothing we can do. We should spend more time doing the following three things:

1. Enhance project experience
2. Continue to improve your resume
3. Prepare for technical interviews

## Reinforce project experience

If you don’t have internship experience in the school recruitment, you will be at a disadvantage in finding a job (no way, it’s too busy), and you need to make more efforts in the project experience part to make up for it.

It is recommended that you try your best to strengthen your project experience, improve existing projects or do more highlight projects, and try to make up for it through project experience as much as possible.

The focus of your interview is the knowledge points related to your project experience. If your project experience is relatively simple, the interviewer will not know what to ask. In addition, there is a high probability that you will be asked about knowledge points that are not covered in your project experience but are mentioned in the skill introduction. Skills like Redis are basically necessary for interviewing Java back-end positions. I think most interviewers should ask about it.

It is recommended to read this article on the website: [Project Experience Guide](https://javaguide.cn/interview-preparation/project-experience-guide.html).

## **Improve resume**

You must definitely pay attention to your resume! It is recommended to spend at least 2 to 3 days specifically improving your resume. Moreover, it will continue to be improved in the future.

For interviewers, they will pay more attention to the following dimensions when screening resumes:

1. **Internship/Work Experience**: See if you have good internship experience. Internship/work experience in a large company and related to the interview position is the best.
2. **Award-winning experience**: If you have an award-winning experience with relatively high value (high-profile events such as ACM, Alibaba Cloud Tianchi), it will also be a bonus point, especially for school recruitment. This type of job seeker is the target of many big companies (but it does not mean that you can enter a big company after winning an award, you still need to perform well in the interview). For social recruitment, award-winning experience plays a relatively small role, and past work experience and project experience are usually more valued.
3. **Project experience**: Project experience is very important for the interview. The interviewer will focus on it, and it is also the focus of competent interview questions.
4. **Skills matching**: See whether your skills meet the needs of the position. Before submitting your resume, be sure to confirm whether your skills profile lacks any skills required for the position you want to submit.
5. **Education**: Compared with other industries, programmer job interviews are relatively tolerant of academic qualifications. As long as you are outstanding in other aspects, you can make up for the shortcomings of academic qualifications. You have to know that in many industries, such as lawyers and finance, academic qualifications are a stepping stone. If the academic qualifications do not meet the requirements, there will be no direct interview opportunities. However, as interviews are becoming more and more demanding, some large factories, state-owned enterprises and research institutes have begun to require academic qualifications. Many positions require 211/985, and even a master's degree is required. In short, it is difficult to change academic qualifications. If the school is poor, just apply to companies that do not have clear requirements for academic qualifications and strive to improve your hard power in other aspects.

For most job seekers, internship/work experience, project experience, and skill matching are more important. However, it is not ruled out that some companies will block people because of their academic qualifications.

For detailed guidelines on writing a programmer resume, please refer to this article: [Programmer Resume Writing Guide (Important)](https://javaguide.cn/interview-preparation/resume-guide.html).

## **Prepare for technical interviews**

Before the interview, you must prepare in advance for common interview questions, which are eight-part essays:

- What knowledge points may be involved in your interview and which knowledge points are the key points.
- What questions are frequently asked in interviews and how should you answer them during the interview? (It is strongly not recommended to memorize by rote. First: How much can you remember by memorizing this way? How long can you remember it? Second: It is difficult to persist in learning by memorizing questions!)

For the key points of Java back-end interview review, please read this article: [What are the key points of Java back-end interview?](https://javaguide.cn/interview-preparation/key-points-of-interview.html).

Different types of companies have different emphasis on skills requirements. For example, Tencent and Byte may pay more attention to computer basics such as networks and operating systems. Companies like Alibaba and Meituan may value your project experience and practical capabilities more.

You must not hold the thought that the examination of eight-legged essays or basic questions is of little significance. If you review with this kind of thinking, the effect may not be very good. In fact, I personally think it is very meaningful. Eight-part essay or basic knowledge will also be frequently used in daily development. For example, if you don't understand the rejection strategy and core parameter configuration of the thread pool, you may not understand how to use the thread pool in actual projects, and problems may easily arise. Moreover, in fact, this kind of basic questions are the easiest to prepare for, while various underlying principles, system design, scenario questions, and digging into your project are the most difficult!

My first recommendation for eight-part essay materials is my ["Java Interview Guide North"](https://javaguide.cn/zhuanlan/java-mian-shi-zhi-bei.html) and [JavaGuide](https://javaguide.cn/home.html). It contains not only original eight-part essays, but also a lot of useful information that is helpful for actual development. In addition to my information, you can also go online to find some other high-quality articles and videos to watch.
