Before the interview, it is strongly recommended that you take a self-test with common interview questions to check your mastery. This is a very practical tip for preparing for technical interviews.

In the **"Technical Interview Questions Self-Assessment"** of **["Java Interview Guide"](../zhuanlan/java-mian-shi-zhi-bei.md)**, I summarized the most common interview questions on the most important knowledge points in Java interviews and presented them in the way of interview questions.

I will give the importance of each interview question for self-test, so that you can selectively self-test according to your own situation when time is tight. Moreover, I will also give hints to help you recall the corresponding knowledge points.

If you really have no clue during the interview, a good interviewer will also give you hints.
