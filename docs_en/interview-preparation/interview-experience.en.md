The ancients said: "You can attack jade with stones from other mountains." Being good at learning from the successful experiences or failures of other people’s interviews can help you avoid many detours.

In **["Java Interview Guide North"](../zhuanlan/java-mian-shi-zhi-bei.md)**'s **"Interview Chapter"**, I shared 15+ high-quality Java back-end interview articles, including those recruited from schools, some recruited from companies, some from large factories, and some from small and medium-sized factories.

If you are a student who is not in a major, you can also find the corresponding interview experience written by students who are not in a major in these articles.

Moreover, [Knowledge Planet](https://javaguide.cn/about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.html) also has a special topic dedicated to sharing interviews and interview questions, which will share many high-quality interviews and interview questions.

Compared with interview interviews on Niuke.com or other websites, the interviews compiled in "Java Interview Guide" are of higher quality, and I will provide high-quality reference materials.

Many students want to say: "Why not just give a specific answer?". The main reasons are as follows:

1. The reference materials should be explained in more detail, and they can also allow you to review relevant knowledge points.
2. The reference materials given are basically my original work. If I want to improve the answers to interview questions later, I don’t need to modify the answers I wrote in the previous interview one by one (many questions in the interview are relatively similar). Of course, it is impossible for my original articles to cover every point of the interview. For answers to some of the interview questions, I have selected high-quality articles written by other technical bloggers, and the quality of the articles is very high.
