## "In-depth understanding of distributed systems"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/deep-understanding-of-distributed-system.png)

**["In-depth Understanding of Distributed Systems"](https://book.douban.com/subject/35794814/)** is an original distributed Chinese book published in 2022. It mainly talks about the basic concepts, common challenges and consensus algorithms in the distributed field.

The author spends a lot of space to introduce the very important consensus algorithm in the distributed field, and also takes you to implement the Paxos algorithm, the originator of the consensus algorithm, from scratch based on the Go language.

To be honest, I haven't started reading this book yet. but! I have carefully read almost every article related to distribution on the blog of the author of this book. The author began to conceive of "In-depth Understanding of Distributed Systems" in 2019, started writing it in 2020, and took nearly two years to finally submit it.

The author wrote a special article to introduce the story behind this book. Interested friends can check it out by themselves: <https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/487534882>.

Finally, put the code repository and errata address of this book: <https://github.com/tangwz/DistSysDeepDive>.

## "Data-intensive application system design"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/ddia.png)

I highly recommend **["Designing Data-Intensive Application"](https://book.douban.com/subject/30329536/)** (DDIA, data-intensive application system design), which is worth reading many times! Nearly 90% of people on Douban gave this book a five-star rating after reading it.

This book mainly talks about distributed databases, data partitions, transactions, distributed systems, etc.

You may have heard of most of the concepts introduced in the book before, but after reading the contents of the book, you may suddenly realize: "Wow! That's it! Isn't this the principle of a certain technology?".

I have previously written an introduction and recommendation for this book in Zhihu answers. Friends who have not read it can check it out: [What programming books have you become addicted to after reading them? ](https://www.zhihu.com/question/50408698/answer/2278198495). In addition, if you find it difficult to read this book and cannot understand many parts, I recommend ["DDIA Chapter-by-Chapter Intensive Reading"] written by the author of "In-depth Understanding of Distributed Systems" (https://ddia.qtmuniao.com).

## "In-depth understanding of distributed transactions"

**["In-depth Understanding of Distributed Transactions"](https://book.douban.com/subject/35626925/)** One of the authors of this book is the founder of the Apache ShenYu (incubating) gateway and the founder of distributed transaction frameworks such as Hmily, RainCat, and Myth.

When learning distributed transactions, you can refer to this book. Although there are some minor errors and logical inconsistencies, it is generally a good introduction to various distributed transaction solutions.

## "From Paxos to Zookeeper"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/image-20211216161350118.png)

**["From Paxos to Zookeeper"](https://book.douban.com/subject/26292004/)** is a good book to introduce you to distributed theory. This book mainly introduces several typical distributed consistency protocols and ideas for solving distributed consistency problems, focusing on the Paxos and ZAB protocols.

PS: Zookeeper is not used much now, so you don’t need to focus on learning it, but Paxos and ZAB protocols are still worthy of in-depth study.

## "In-depth understanding of distributed consensus algorithms"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/deep-dive-into-distributed-consensus-algorithms.png)

**["In-depth Understanding of Distributed Consensus Algorithms"](https://book.douban.com/subject/36335459/)** Detailed analysis of the core principles and implementation details of mainstream distributed consensus algorithms such as Paxos, Raft, and Zab. If you want to understand the distributed consensus algorithm, you may wish to refer to the summary of this book.

## "Microservice Architecture Design Pattern"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/microservices-patterns.png)

Chris Richardson, the author of **["Microservice Architecture Design Patterns"](https://book.douban.com/subject/33425123/)**, is rated as one of the top ten software architects in the world and a pioneer of microservice architecture. This book brings together 44 proven architectural design patterns that solve difficult problems such as service decomposition, transaction management, querying, and cross-service communication. The content in the book is not only theoretically solid, but also guides readers step by step through rich Java code examples to master the development and deployment of production-level microservice architecture applications.

## "Phoenix Architecture"

![](https://oss.javaguide.cn/github/javaguide/books/f5bec14d3b404ac4b041d723153658b5.png)

**["Phoenix Architecture"](https://book.douban.com/subject/35492898/)** This book is a summary of teacher Zhou Zhiming's many years of architecture and R&D experience. The content is very informative, with both depth and breadth, combining theory with practice!

As the subtitle of the book title "Building Reliable Large-scale Distributed Systems" says, the main content of this book is: "How to build a reliable distributed large-scale software system", covering the following aspects:

- The evolution of software architecture from monolithic to microservices to serviceless.
- What issues should architects pay attention to when designing architecture, and what are some better practices.
- The cornerstone of distributed consensus is the common distributed consensus algorithms Paxos and Multi Paxos.
- Immutable infrastructure such as virtualized containers and service grids.
- A guide to avoid pitfalls when moving towards microservices.

I have recommended this book many times. See the historical article for details:

## Others

- ["Distributed Systems: Concept and Design"](https://book.douban.com/subject/21624776/): It is a textbook type, the content is complete but boring, it can be used as a reference book;
- ["Distributed Architecture Principles and Practice"](https://book.douban.com/subject/35689350/): Published in 2021, it is not popular and I haven't read it yet.
