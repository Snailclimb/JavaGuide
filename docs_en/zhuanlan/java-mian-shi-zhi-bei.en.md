I spent three years writing a "Java Interview Guide" for Java interviews. The content is of very high quality and is very suitable for friends who are preparing for Java interviews!

Current results: cumulative readings **270w+**, likes **3550+**, comments **1130+** (I will reply to almost every question-type comment after seeing it).

## Introduction

**"Java Interview Guide North"** is an internal booklet of my [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md), which is complementary to the content of [JavaGuide Open Source Edition](https://javaguide.cn/). Compared with the open source version, "Java Interview Guide" adds the following content (not only these content):

- 17+ articles teach you step-by-step how to prepare for interviews, and 50+ detailed explanations of common questions during the interview preparation process, allowing you to prepare for Java interviews more efficiently.
- More comprehensive eight-part essay interview questions (system design, scenario questions, common frameworks, distributed & microservices, high concurrency...).
- Selection of high-quality interview interviews (compared to interview interviews on Niuke.com or other websites, the interviews compiled in "Java Interview Guide" are of higher quality, and I will provide high-quality reference materials).
- Self-assessment of technical interview questions (one of the tips for preparing technical eight-part essays efficiently is to self-assess yourself a lot and check for any omissions and fill in the gaps).
- Leveling guide (experience sharing that helps personal growth).

"Java Interview Guide" will update and improve the content according to the interview situation every year to ensure the timeliness of content quality. Moreover, you only need to join [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md) once to gain permanent access to "Java Interview Guide", which will be continuously updated and improved.

## Content Overview

![Content Overview of "Java Interview Guide"](https://oss.javaguide.cn/javamianshizhibei/javamianshizhibei-content-overview.png)

### Interview preparation

In **"Interview Preparation"**, I wrote 17+ articles to teach you step by step how to prepare for interviews, and 50+ detailed explanations of common questions during the interview preparation process. Here are answers to common questions in preparing for interviews, covering project experience, resume writing, source code learning, algorithm preparation, interview resources, etc.

In addition, considering that many friends lack project experience, I also recommended many niche but high-quality practical projects, including videos, open source projects, business systems, and various wheel-type projects with relatively high gold content.

### Technical interview questions

The content of **"Technical Interview Questions"** is complementary to the JavaGuide open source version. It not only includes the most basic Java, common frameworks and other eight-part articles, but also includes advanced content such as system design, distribution, and high concurrency.

### Interview Chapter

The ancients said: "You can attack jade with stones from other mountains." Being good at learning from the successful experiences or failures of other people’s interviews can help you avoid many detours.

**"Interview Chapter"** I will mainly share some high-quality Java back-end interview experiences, some are recruited from schools, some are recruited from society, some are from large factories, and some are from small and medium-sized factories.

**Why do you recommend choosing the interview experience compiled by me? **

Compared with the large amount of interview information on platforms such as Niuke.com, the interviews provided in "Java Interview Guide" put more effort into quality screening and value mining. Every included interview strives to:

- **True and inspiring content**: Prioritize experiences that reflect actual interview scenarios, key points of inspection, and interviewer’s thinking.
- **Provide deep learning resources**: For the key questions that arise in the interview, we will carefully provide high-quality reference materials (usually in-depth analysis articles written by me) or directly give core reference answers.

Compared with interview interviews on Niuke.com or other websites, the interviews compiled in "Java Interview Guide" are of higher quality, and I will provide high-quality reference materials.

In addition, [Knowledge Planet](https://javaguide.cn/about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.html) also has a special topic dedicated to sharing interviews and interview questions, which will share many high-quality interviews and interview questions.

### Technical interview questions self-test

In order to allow friends to self-test to check their mastery, I also launched the **"Technical Interview Questions Self-Test"** series. However, currently only the Java and database self-tests have been updated and are being continuously updated.

One of the tips for preparing technical eight-part essays efficiently is to do a lot of self-testing and check for gaps.

### Leveling Guide

**"Leveling Guide"** This series mainly contains some experience sharing that is helpful for personal growth.

Every piece of content is very informative, and many golfers said they gained a lot after reading it. However, the most important thing is the unity of knowledge and action.

### Work

**"Work"** The main content of this series is to share content that is helpful for personal and workplace development as well as problems that are often encountered at work.
