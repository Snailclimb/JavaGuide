## Introduction

**"Java Must-Read Source Code Series"** is an internal booklet of my [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md). It has currently compiled the source code of frameworks/middleware such as Dubbo 2.6.x, Netty 4.x, SpringBoot 2.1, etc. In the future, we will sort out more high-quality source code worth reading and continue to improve it.

The structure is clear and the content is detailed, making it very suitable for students who want to learn the source code of the framework/middleware in depth.
