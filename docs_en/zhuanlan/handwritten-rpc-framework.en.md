## Introduction

**"Handwritten RPC Framework"** is an internal booklet of my [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md). I wrote 12 articles to explain how to implement a simple RPC framework from scratch based on Netty+Kyro+Zookeeper.

Although Sparrow is small, it has all the necessary features. The project code has detailed comments and clear structure. It also integrates the Check Style standard code structure, making it very suitable for reading and learning.

Through this simple wheel, you can learn the underlying principles and principles of RPC and the application of various Java coding practices. You can even use it as your senior project/project experience option, which is pretty cool! Compared with other job seekers whose project experience is in various systems, Wheel Builder is definitely more likely to win the interviewer's favor.
