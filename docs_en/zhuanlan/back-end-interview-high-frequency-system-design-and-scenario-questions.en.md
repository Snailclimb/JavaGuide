## Introduction

**"Back-end Interview High Frequency System Design & Scenario Questions"** is an internal booklet of my [Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md). It contains common system design cases such as short-chain systems, flash kill systems, and high-frequency scenario questions such as massive data deduplication and third-party authorized login.

In recent years, as domestic technical interviews have become more and more demanding, more and more companies have begun to examine system design and scenario issues in interviews to more comprehensively examine job seekers, whether it is school recruitment or social recruitment. However, it is rare for a normal interview to be full of scenario questions. The interviewer will usually intersperse one or two system design and scenario questions during the interview to examine you.

Therefore, I summarized this "Back-end Interview High-Frequency System Design & Scenario Questions", which includes common system design cases such as short-chain systems, flash sale systems, and high-frequency scenario questions such as massive data deduplication and third-party authorized login.

Even if you are not preparing for an interview, I strongly recommend that you read this series of articles carefully, which is very helpful to improve your system design thinking and ability to solve practical problems. Moreover, many of the cases involved can be used in your own projects, such as lottery system design, third-party authorized login, and the correct way to implement delayed tasks in Redis.

"Back-End Interview High-Frequency System Design & Scenario Questions" itself is part of the "Java Interview Guide". Due to the large content, it is mentioned separately.
