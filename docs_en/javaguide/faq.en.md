## Does JavaGuide support RSS?

Must support! Recommended RSS Subscription to this website to get the latest updates.

## Is there a PDF version of JavaGuide?

Since JavaGuide content is constantly being improved, there is no fully synchronized PDF version available. If you want a PDF version, you can consider **"JavaGuide Interview Crash Edition"**, which is a condensed summary of the JavaGuide content.

"JavaGuide Interview Crash Edition" can be obtained by replying "**PDF**" in the background of my official account. It is free. In addition to "JavaGuide Interview Crash Edition", you will also receive multiple high-quality interview PDF manuals for free.

## What do you think about the large number of stars in JavaGuide?

[JavaGuide](https://github.com/Snailclimb) is currently one of the projects with the largest number of stars in the Java field, and has topped GitHub Trending many times.

However, there is really nothing to complain about. Because the value of tutorials is actually relatively low, and the large number of stars is mainly because the audience is relatively wide. Everyone thinks it is good, and clicking a star is equivalent to collecting it. For many particularly excellent frameworks, the number of stars may only be a few K. Therefore, simply looking at the number of stars is meaningless, just treat it as a joke!

In the process of maintaining this project, some people also dissed it: "The md project has no gold content and is an embarrassment to the Chinese people!".

For people who say this kind of thing, I don’t think it has any impact on me, so I will continue to improve and make JavaGuide better! In fact, many foreign projects are also pure MD! For example, the awesome series and job interview series launched by foreign friends. No need to say more, actions speak for themselves! Damn!

A very important aspect of open source is collaboration. If you open source a project and then no longer maintain it, and others submit issues/prs to you but you don’t handle it, then open source means nothing!

## Will JavaGuide be released as a paper book?

A relatively clear answer can be given: **I am not considering publishing a book for the time being**.

About a year after the JavaGuide project was born, teachers from the publishing house contacted me. Since I knew that my personal abilities still needed to be developed, I declined. In the past few years, because the project is still somewhat well-known, more teachers from publishing houses have approached me to publish books, and I have declined them all.

**Publishing a book can not only make you famous but also make some money. Why don’t I consider publishing a book? **

- I am not very satisfied with many contents of JavaGuide, and they have been under maintenance. Careful friends will understand by looking at my [commit record](https://github.com/Snailclimb/JavaGuide/commits/main).
- The open source version is easier to maintain and modify, and also allows more people to participate in the construction of the project more conveniently. This is also my original intention of doing this project.
- I think publishing a book is a sacred thing, and I don’t think I’m capable enough.
- My personal energy is limited. Not only do I have my own job, but I also built a [Knowledge Planet](https://javaguide.cn/about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.html) to earn some extra money, and I also have to maintain and improve JavaGuide.
-…

It has been quietly improved in the past few years. I sincerely hope that JavaGuide will get better and better and help more friends! Everyone is also welcome to participate!

## Why are there some paid articles on JavaGuide?

It's true, there are indeed very, very few paid articles on JavaGuide, less than 10, which is insignificant compared to the content of the entire website.

These paid articles are exclusive to [Knowledge Planet](https://javaguide.cn/about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.html). They are used by me to attract traffic to Knowledge Planet. They actually have no impact on the overall reading.

I also know that people don’t like marketing, so I will let myself control it. I don’t cut leeks, and I don’t sell anxiety. I just make a small amount of money to improve my family’s quality of life.

**Create content with heart and sincerely hope it can help others. **
