**For students who are not preparing for interviews**, this document tends to provide you with a more detailed learning path with a clear directory, allowing you to have a clear understanding of the overall knowledge system of Java. You can follow videos, books or official documents to learn a certain knowledge point, and then come here to find the corresponding summary to help you better master the corresponding knowledge point. Even if you have a basic knowledge of programming and want to learn a certain knowledge point, you can directly read my summary, which will make your learning efficiency very high.

**For students preparing for interviews**, this document covers a summary of common interview questions that cover the core knowledge that Java programmers need to master.

Most people read JavaGuide to prepare technical eight-part essays. **So how can we prepare technical eight-part essays more efficiently? **

For technical eight-part essays, try not to memorize them by rote. This method is very boring and has limited improvement in your abilities! but! It is unrealistic to not memorize anything at all. I just want to understand memory in combination with actual application scenarios and actual combat.

I have always felt that it is best to combine the interview eight-part essay with practical application scenarios and actual combat. Many students are now in the wrong direction. They just memorized eight-part essays and learned liberal arts abruptly, which is of course boring.

For example: Your project needs to use Redis for caching. After you briefly understood and practiced the simple use of Redis according to the official website, you read the eight-part article corresponding to Redis. You discovered that Redis can be used for current limiting and distributed locks, so you practiced it in the project and mastered the corresponding eight-part essay. Then, you discovered that when Redis memory is not enough, you can still use Redis Cluster to solve the problem, so you practiced it again and mastered the corresponding eight-part essay.

Moreover, **skilled interviewers in interviews will ask some technical questions based on your project experience**.

For example: If your project uses a message queue, the interviewer may ask you: Why use a message queue? Which modules in the project use message queues? How to ensure that messages are not lost? How to ensure the order of messages? (Prepare based on the specific message queue you use)...

**Be sure to remember that your main goal is to understand and memorize key words, not to memorize them word for word like memorizing a text! **

In addition, it is also a good choice to record blogs or use your own understanding to explain the corresponding knowledge points to others.

Finally, students preparing for technical interviews must review regularly (the self-test method is very good), otherwise they will indeed forget it.
