Welcome to participate in the maintenance of JavaGuide. This is a very meaningful thing. For details, please see: [JavaGuide Contribution Guide](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/464832264).

You can contribute in the following directions:

- Correct typos. After all, the content is basically typed by hand, so clerical errors are inevitable.
- Modify and improve the original content, such as improving the answer to an interview question or improving the content of an article.
- New content, such as adding frequently asked interview questions and adding detailed explanations of important knowledge points.

The current contribution rewards are also relatively rich and complete. For users who have contributed multiple times, there are physical rewards such as headphones and keyboards as well as cash rewards!

Be sure to pay attention to the **typesetting specifications**:

If you want to raise an issue/question, it is highly recommended to read the following information:

- ["The Wisdom of Asking Questions"](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way)
- ["How to ask questions to the open source community"](https://github.com/seajs/seajs/issues/545)
- ["How to report bugs effectively"](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs-cn.html)
- ["How to submit unanswerable questions to open source projects"](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25795393).

In addition, you can refer to and study other people's articles, but you must not copy and paste other people's content. Try to be easier to understand than what others have written. Speak it in your own words, simplify the expression appropriately, and highlight the key points!
