I graduated from college in 2019. When I was preparing for interviews in my junior year, I open sourced JavaGuide. I shared some of my summary of my interview preparation process through JavaGuide without reservation.

The original idea of ​​open source JavaGuide originated from my own confusing learning experience. The main purpose is to use this open source platform to help some friends who encounter problems in learning Java or during the interview process.

- **For Java beginners:** This document tends to provide you with a more detailed learning path with a clear directory, allowing you to have a clear understanding of the overall knowledge system of Java. You can follow the video or book to learn a certain knowledge point, and then come here to find the corresponding summary to help you better master the corresponding knowledge point.
- **For non-Java beginners:** This document is more suitable for reviewing knowledge and preparing for interviews, allowing you to figure out which questions the interview should focus on.

**Since the content of this website is completely open source and maintained and improved by everyone, the content quality is relatively high. ** If you also want to participate in the maintenance and construction of JavaGuide, please check the [Contribution Guide](./contribution-guideline.md).

Compared to other friends who learned things through JavaGuide or helped get offers, JavaGuide means more to me. It is no exaggeration to say that sometimes it really feels like my own child is growing up little by little, and I have been caring for it with all my heart. Although it took me a long time to maintain it, I think it was very worth it! Very meaningful!

However, I hope you don’t take chances when it comes to the interview, you still need to be tough! **I hope this document points the way for you to learn Java, not just for interviews. **

In addition, JavaGuide cannot cover all the content in the interview, especially interviews with Alibaba and Meituan that are more in-depth. You can conduct targeted in-depth study based on your target company, read more interview experiences of the target company to check for any gaps, test yourself if you have nothing to do, and think and summarize more.

come on! Awesome!

## Official Knowledge Planet

For students preparing for interviews, I highly recommend a pure [Java Interview Knowledge Planet](../about-the-author/zhishixingqiu-two-years.md) created by me. It has a lot of useful information and a great learning atmosphere!

The following are some of the services provided by Planet (click on the image below to get a detailed introduction to Knowledge Planet):
